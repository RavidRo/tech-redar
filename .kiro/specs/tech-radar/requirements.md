# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Tech Radar is a visual tool for tracking and communicating the adoption lifecycle of technologies within an organization. It displays technologies across different categories (Tools, Techniques, Platforms, Languages & Frameworks) and stages (Hold, Assess, Trial, Adopt) in a radar-like visualization. The system should allow users to view, search, filter, and manage technology entries while maintaining historical records of stage transitions and providing detailed information about each technology.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Radar Visualization

**User Story:** As a technology leader, I want to view all technologies in a visual radar format, so that I can quickly assess our technology landscape and adoption stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the tech radar page THEN the system SHALL display all technologies in a circular radar visualization
2. WHEN displaying technologies THEN the system SHALL organize them by category (Tools, Techniques, Platforms, Languages & Frameworks) in different quadrants
3. WHEN displaying technologies THEN the system SHALL position them by stage (Hold, Assess, Trial, Adopt) in concentric rings from outer to inner
4. WHEN a technology is displayed THEN the system SHALL show its name as a clickable element on the radar
5. IF there are many technologies in one area THEN the system SHALL handle overlapping by adjusting positions or providing hover interactions

### Requirement 2: Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search and filter technologies, so that I can quickly find specific technologies or categories I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters text in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter technologies by name, category, or tags
2. WHEN a user selects a category filter THEN the system SHALL show only technologies from that category
3. WHEN a user selects a stage filter THEN the system SHALL show only technologies in that stage
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update the radar visualization in real-time
5. WHEN no technologies match the filters THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3: Technology Details

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to view detailed information about a technology, so that I can understand its current status, history, and relevant documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a technology in the radar THEN the system SHALL display a detailed view with all technology information
2. WHEN displaying technology details THEN the system SHALL show name, category, current stage, tags, and description
3. WHEN displaying technology details THEN the system SHALL show the complete stage transition history with dates
4. IF a technology has an ADR link THEN the system SHALL display it as a clickable link
5. IF a technology has a details page URL THEN the system SHALL display it as a clickable link
6. WHEN viewing details THEN the system SHALL provide a way to close the detail view and return to the radar

### Requirement 4: Add Technologies

**User Story:** As a technology administrator, I want to add new technologies to the radar, so that I can keep the tech radar current with our evolving technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks "Add Technology" THEN the system SHALL display a form for creating new technologies
2. WHEN creating a technology THEN the system SHALL require name, category, and initial stage
3. WHEN creating a technology THEN the system SHALL allow optional tags, details page URL, and ADR link
4. WHEN a technology is created THEN the system SHALL automatically set the discovery date to the current date
5. WHEN a technology is created THEN the system SHALL add it to the radar visualization immediately
6. IF a technology name already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and show an error message

### Requirement 5: Update Technologies

**User Story:** As a technology administrator, I want to update existing technologies, so that I can reflect changes in adoption stages and maintain accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator selects a technology for editing THEN the system SHALL display an editable form with current values
2. WHEN updating a technology stage THEN the system SHALL create a new stage transition record with the current date
3. WHEN updating a technology stage THEN the system SHALL require an ADR link for the transition
4. WHEN updating other fields THEN the system SHALL save changes without creating stage transition records
5. WHEN changes are saved THEN the system SHALL update the radar visualization immediately
6. WHEN stage transitions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain the complete history for audit purposes

### Requirement 6: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and performant, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and with large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the radar within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
2. WHEN the radar contains more than 100 technologies THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth interactions
3. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a touch-friendly interface with appropriate sizing
4. WHEN accessed on tablets THEN the system SHALL optimize the layout for the available screen space
5. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options

### Requirement 7: User Experience and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to provide clear navigation and user experience, so that I can efficiently accomplish my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first visits the application THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of how to interact with the radar
2. WHEN hovering over technologies THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide loading states and confirmation feedback
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
5. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support standard accessibility patterns
